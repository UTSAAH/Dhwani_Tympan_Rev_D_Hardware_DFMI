D_Tympan_DFMI_1.0 consisits of PCB design files catering to the requirements of Indian PCB Manufacturers. 

The following are the changes done in the PCB design files (.pcb file):  

	1.Four layered board with power/ gnd planes as follows:
		Top Cu - GND plane   
		Second layer(In. Cu 1) - None  
		Third layer(In. Cu 2) - 3.3 V power plane  
		Bottom Cu - GND plane  
	2.Details about vias:  
		Through hole vias - 0.6mm/0.4mm  
		Blind vias ( In. Cu 2 - B. Cu) - 0.45mm/ 0.15mm  
	3. Changes in component placement:  
		R 20, R 23 - Moved from B. Cu to F. Cu layer  
		C14, C20, C21, C22,C34 - Moved from B. CU to F. Cu layer
